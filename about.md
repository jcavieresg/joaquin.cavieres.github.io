I'm a PhD (c) in Statistics of University of Valparaíso, Chile. My main interests include Bayesian Statistics, Spatial / Spatio-Temporal Models, Smoothing Splines and Low Rank Approximation Matrices. Generally I'm working with $\mathtt{R}$, Template Model Builder $(\mathtt{TMB})$ and $\mathtt{tmbstan}$ to create models applied in fisheries science or ecology but also I have participated in a few projects in Machine learning using $\texttt{h2o}$ and $\texttt{Sparklyr}$.
